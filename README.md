But there are far more uncomfortable, hostile and dangerous places to be, and people like *you and me* are living in them.

While I‘m struggling with the current heatwave, someone else is struggling to make a living.  
While I‘m angry that I can‘t use my preferred username on an internet platform, someone else has to make sure that their username doesn‘t reveal too much information about them.  
**While Government A is putting sanctions on Country B, it‘s the individual people in that country that have to struggle with the consequences, not their leaders.**  
While I am trying to get a raise, someone else is trying to stay alive.  

This doesn‘t mean that our personal problems are irrelevant, but I think it’s important to be aware that many of us are lucky to have been born in a good place, and also that many of us aren't as lucky.  
The least we can do is to treat others with respect, decency and compassion, no matter where they come from or what their background is.
